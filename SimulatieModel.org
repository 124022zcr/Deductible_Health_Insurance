| deductible |  150 |  155 |  165 |  170 |  220 |  350 |

An important consideration of any copayment in health care is whether or not an
individual is at the margin effected by the copayment. To illustrate, if you
know that your health care costs will exceed a 1000 euros, a change of
deductible from 150 to 155 euro is unlikely to affect you.

To capture this effect, we would like to know who is "at the margin" for a
policy measure. That is, we want to keep track of the distribution of
expenditures in the population. To do this, we define a set of bins to capture
health care expenditure.

** Bins

We define as healthcare expenditure, all expenditure under the mandatory
deductible. We start by only considering people without a voluntary deductible.

We define the bins as follows. Pool all data for the 6 years 2008-2013. Take out
observations with zero expenditure in a year. These go into the 0-bin. Split the
remaining observations into $n$ expenditure bins such that each bin has the same
number of observations. If we choose $n=100$, we have expenditure percentiles
(conditional on positive expenditure).

Then we can add variables for each individual and each year of the bin in which
the observation is. Then we can estimate for an individual $i$ who was in bin
$j_{-1}$ in $t-1$, the probability of being in bin $j$ in year $t$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
Prob(i \in j_t|j_{-1}) = \alpha_t + \alpha_i + \alpha_{j_{-1}} + \psi_{j_{-1}} d_{it}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_t$ denotes the time fixed effect, $\alpha_i$ individual fixed
effect, $\alpha_{j_{-1}}$ the bin (of the preceding year) fixed effect and
$\psi_{j_{-1}}$ captures the effect of the deductible on the transition
probabilities.

Remark: given that we would guess that the deductible reduces health care
expenditure, it is perhaps better to estimate the cumulative distribution rather
than individual probabilities. To illustrate, in the model above, if $\psi > 0$,
the probability of ending up $j$ increases --compared to a base category-- with
deductible $d$ irrespective of whether $j$ is higher or lower than $j_{-1}$. Is
it possible to estimate $Prob(i \leq j_t | j_{-1})$? Then we expect that $\psi >
0$: an increase in $d$ makes it more likely that you end up in bin $j$ or lower.
This seems possible, see for instance [[https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat504/node/176][this link]]; but I have never used it.

Once we can estimate an equation like the one above for all the data, we can
re-estimate the equation for certain groups: male vs female, age-cohorts,
chronic illness etc.

** Theory

A first simple theoretical framework could be the following. Assume that people
can decide whether to accept the treatment "in their bin" or choose no
treatment. That is, we assume that people cannot reduce their treatment at the
margin. Each patient is offered one treatment only (per year) and decides
whether to accept this treatment or not. Put differently, a series of treatments
is offered to a patient as an indivisble good. Note that we can test this assumption
in the data (and it will probably not hold).

The figure below plots costs $c$ of treatment vs values $v$ of treatments. Each
treatment is a point in this figure; a combination of $c$ and $v$.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def deductible(c,d):
   return min(c,d)

range_c = np.arange(0,350,0.1)
range_v170 = [deductible(c,170) for c in range_c]
range_v220 = [deductible(c,220) for c in range_c]

plt.plot(range_c,range_v220,'-', color = 'r', linewidth = 2)
plt.plot(range_c,range_v170,'-', color = 'b', linewidth = 2)
plt.fill_between(range_c, range_v170, range_v220, facecolor='yellow')
plt.xlabel('cost')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.savefig('deduct.png')
#+END_SRC


[[./deduct.png]]


Hence, as the deductible increases --say, from 170 (blue line) to 220 (red line)
as in the figure above-- people being offered a treatment in the yellow area
will decide to drop the treatment. Under the high deductible, the value $v$ of
these treatments is less than the cost to the patient (while it was the other
way around with the low deductible)

This is the expenditure reducing effect of an
increase in the deductible. The elasticity of this increase in the deductible is
determined by the probability mass over this area.

When you expect that the effect of a change in the deductible is smaller for
high cost treatments than for low cost treatments, you assume that the mass of
treatments with value between $[170,220]$ is higher for low cost treatments.


* What equation do we want to estimate?

Let $a$ denote the agent. Consider the case where $a$ is in bin $i$ in this
period $t$ and was in bin $j$ in the previous period $t-1$. Then we could
estimate the following equation:

\begin{equation}
Prob(a \text{ in } i \text{ in } t|a \text{ in } j \text{ in } t-1) = \alpha_t + \alpha_{ij} + \beta_i d_t T_{at}
\end{equation}

In words, the probability that $a$ is in bin $i$ in period $t$, conditional on
being in $j$ in $t-1$ is determined by a time effect $\alpha_t$. Question:
should the time effect depend on $i$ as well? Does it simply drop out now?

It depends on markov probabilities $\alpha_{ij}$.

And it depends on the deductible in period $t$, $d_t$, for agents that are older
than 18 (i.e. have $T_{at} =1$; while $T_{at}=0$ for people under 18).

It seems natural that $\beta_i$ depends on $i$: for high $i$, one would expect
the probability of ending up in this bin to fall with the level of the
deductible while for low $i$ bins, this probability increases.

Whether or not the probability increases with the size of the deductible may
depend on whether the bin lies (just) above or below the deductible. As the
deductible changes over time, do we need to work with $\beta_{it}$ for bins $i$
in between $d_{2008}$ and $d_{2013}$?


* Markov matrices

Below are the Markov transition matrices as calculated by Minke. The column indicates the bin an agent was in the previous year, $t-1$ and the row indicates the bin he moves to at time $t$.
We plot for each year, the probability that someone moves to a certain bin $t$ conditional on the bin he was in at $t-1$.

The bins are defined as follows:

|                  | bin 0 | bin 1 |  bin 2 |  bin 3 |   bin 4 |      bin 5 |
|------------------+-------+-------+--------+--------+---------+------------|
| max. expenditure |     0 | 88.61 | 308.18 | 850.88 | 2514.43 | 2253642.00 |

That is, people with 0 expenditure are in bin 0; people with expenditure in $\langle 0,88.61]$ are in bin 1 etc.

As the figures show, you are most likely to stay in the same bin at $t$ that you were in at $t-1$. This persistence is especially high in the highest cost bin (5).
Persistence is lowest when you are in bin 3 (red line has lowest max).

Further, the graphs look pretty stable over time.

A disadvantage of this stability is that the deductible seems to have little effect on the Markov probabilities. However, as the plots below show there is an upward sloping relation between the level of the deductible and the probability that expenditure is very low (up till bin 1) and when it is low (up till bin 2).

Hence for "very low" expenditures (bins 0 and 1) and for "low expenditure" (bins 0, 1 and 2), we see that the probability of ending up with such (low) expenditure increases with the deductible level.

The following block runs this for every bin separately. This shows the following. The probability of ending up in bin 0 or in bin 1 is increasing in the deductible. As probabilities add up to 1, we see that for higher bins, the probability of ending up there actually falls with the deduct.

If we find this confusing that some probabilities increase and others decrease with the deductible, we can also estimate the effects on the cumulative probabilities: $F(i) = prob(bin \leq i)$.

+ TODO: We can also plot these probabilities conditional on your bin in $t-1$. Intuitively, it may be the case that if last year you were in a low bin, the probability that you are in a low bin this year increases with the deduct. But if last year you were in a high bin, the probability of being in a low bin hardly changes with the deduct (as you were expecting costs way above the deduct. this year as well).
